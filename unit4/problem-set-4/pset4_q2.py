Problem set 4 - Question 2 - Dealing with Hands

REPRESENTING HANDS

A hand is the set of letters held by a player during the game. The player is initially dealt a set of random letters.
For example, the player could start out with the following hand: a, q, l, m, u, i, l.
In our program, a hand will be represented as a dictionary:
the keys are (lowercase) letters and the values are the number of times the particular letter is repeated in that hand.
For example, the above hand would be represented as: hand = {'a':1, 'q':1, 'l':2, 'm':1, 'u':1, 'i':1}

Notice how the repeated letter 'l' is represented.
Remember that with a dictionary, the usual way to access a value is hand['a'], where 'a' is the key we want to find.
However, this only works if the key is in the dictionary; otherwise, we get a KeyError.
To avoid this, we can use the call hand.get('a',0).
This is the "safe" way to access a value if we are not sure the key is in the dictionary.
d.get(key,default) returns the value for key if key is in the dictionary d, else default.
If default is not given, it returns None, so that this method never raises a KeyError.

For example:
>>> hand['e']
Traceback (most recent call last):
 File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
KeyError: 'e'
>>> hand.get('e', 0)
0

REMOVING LETTERS FROM A HAND (YOU IMPLEMENT THIS)

The player starts with a hand, a set of letters.
As the player spells out words, letters from this set are used up.
For example, the player could start out with the following hand: a, q, l, m, u, i, l.
The player could choose to spell the word quail .
This would leave the following letters in the player's hand: l, m.
Your task is to implement the function updateHand, which takes in two inputs - a hand and a word (string).
updateHand uses letters from the hand to spell the word, and then returns a copy of the hand, containing only the letters remaining.

For example:
>>> hand = {'a':1, 'q':1, 'l':2, 'm':1, 'u':1, 'i':1}
>>> display_hand(hand) # Implemented for you
a q l l m u i
>>> hand = update_hand(hand, 'quail') # You implement this function!
>>> hand
{'a':0, 'q':0, 'l':1, 'm':1, 'u':0, 'i':0}
>>> display_hand(hand)
l m

def update_hand(hand, word):
    """
    Assumes that 'hand' has all the letters in word.
    In other words, this assumes that however many times
    a letter appears in 'word', 'hand' has at least as
    many of that letter in it. 

    Updates the hand: uses up the letters in the given word
    and returns the new hand, without those letters in it.

    Has no side effects: does not modify hand.
